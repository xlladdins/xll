FORMAT.CHARTTYPE

Changes the chart type for a selected data series, a group of data
series, or an entire chart.

**Syntax**

**FORMAT.CHARTTYPE**(**apply\_to**, group\_num, dimension,
**type\_num**)

**FORMAT.CHARTTYPE**?(apply\_to, group\_num, dimension, type\_num)

Apply\_to    is a number from 1 to 3 specifying what part of a chart the
new chart type effects.

|           |                      |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| **Value** | **Part of chart**    |
| 1         | Selected data series |
| 2         | Group of data series |
| 3         | Entire chart         |

Group\_num    corresponds to the number of the group you want to change
as listed in the Group list box of the Chart Type dialog box, which
appears when you click Chart Type from the Format menu while a chart is
active. Groups are numbered starting with 1 for the group at the top of
the list. This argument is required if apply\_to equals 2; otherwise it
is ignored.

Dimension    specifies whether to apply a 2-D or 3-D chart type. Use 1
for a 2-D chart type or 2 for a 3-D chart type. If omitted, uses the
same dimension as the series, group, or chart to be changed.

Type\_num    specifies the chart type to apply. Meaning of type\_num
varies depending on the value of dimension:

|               |                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Type\_num** | **Chart type if dimension is 1** |
| 1             | Area or 3-D area                 |

| 3             | Column or 3-D column             |
| 4             | Line or 3-D line                 |
| 5             | Pie or 3-D pie                   |
| 6             | Doughnut or 3-D surface          |
