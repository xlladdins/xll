RELREF

Returns the reference of a cell or cells relative to the upper-left cell
of rel\_to\_ref. The reference is given as an R1C1-style relative
reference in the form of text, such as "R\[1\]C\[1\]".

**Syntax**

**RELREF**(**reference, rel\_to\_ref**)

Reference    is the cell or cells to which you want to create a relative
reference.

Rel\_to\_ref    is the cell from which you want to create the relative
reference.

**Tip**   If you know the absolute reference of a cell that you want to
include in a formula, but your formula requires a relative reference,
use RELREF to generate the relative reference. This is especially useful
with the FORMULA function, since its formula\_text argument requires
R1C1-style references, and RELREF returns relative R1C1-style
references. You can also use the FORMULA.CONVERT function to convert
absolute references to relative references.

**Examples**

RELREF($A$1, $C$3) equals "R\[-2\]C\[-2\]"

RELREF($A$1:$E$5, $C$3:$G$7) equals "R\[-2\]C\[-2\]:R\[2\]C\[2\]"

RELREF($A$1:$E$5, $C$3) equals "R\[-2\]C\[-2\]:R\[2\]C\[2\]"

**Related Functions**

ABSREF   Returns the absolute reference of a range of cells to another
range

DEREF   Returns the value of the cells in the reference

FORMULA   Enters values into a cell or range or onto a chart
