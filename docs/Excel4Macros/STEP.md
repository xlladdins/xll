STEP

Stops the normal flow of a macro and calculates it one cell at a time.
Running a macro one cell at a time is called single-stepping and is very
useful when you are debugging a macro. Use the STEP function, instead of
clicking the Step Into button in the Macro dialog box when you want to
start single-stepping at a specific line in a macro. The Macro dialog
box appears when you click the Macros command (Tools menu, Macro
submenu).

**Syntax**

**STEP**( )

**Remarks**

  - > When Microsoft Excel encounters a STEP function, it stops running
    > the macro and displays a dialog box. The dialog box tells you
    > which cell in the macro Microsoft Excel is about to calculate, and
    > what formula is in that cell. You can click Step to carry out the
    > next instruction; click Evaluate to calculate part of the formula;
    > click Halt to interrupt the macro; or click Continue to continue
    > the macro without single-stepping.

  - > When placed at the beginning of a macro, STEP is equivalent to
    > clicking the Macro command on the Tools menu and clicking the Step
    > Into button in the Macro dialog box.

  - > To step through the calculation of a custom function, place the
    > STEP function at the start of the custom function.
