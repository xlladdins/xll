# CHECKBOX.PROPERTIES

Sets various properties of check box and option box controls on a
worksheet or dialog sheet.

**Syntax**

**CHECKBOX.PROPERTIES**(value, link, accel\_text, 3d\_shading,
accel\_text2)

**CHECKBOX.PROPERTIES**?(value, link, accel\_text, 3d\_shading,
accel\_text2,)

Value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the value of the check box or option
button setting that determines whether it is selected or not.

|            |                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| **Value**  | **Box or Button Setting** |
| 0 or FALSE | Off                       |
| 1 or TRUE  | On                        |
| 2          | Mixed                     |

Link&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the cell on the sheet to which the check
box or option button value is linked. Whenever one of these two controls
is changed, the value of the control is entered into the cell.
Similarly, whenever the value in the cell is changed, the setting for
the corresponding check box or option button is also changed. To clear
the link, set this value to an empty string. For example, entering
"TRUE" into a cell linked to a check box will select that check box.

3d\_shading&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that specifies
whether the check box appears as 3-D. If TRUE, the check box will appear
as 3-D. If FALSE or omitted, the check box will not be 3-D. This
argument is available for only worksheets.

Accel\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a text string containing the
character to use as the control's accelerator key on a dialog sheet. The
character is matched against the text of the control, and the first
matching character is underlined. When the user presses ALT+accel\_text
in Microsoft Excel for Windows or COMMAND+accel\_text in Microsoft Excel
for the Macintosh, the control is clicked.

Accel\_text2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a text string containing the
second accelerator key on a dialog sheet. This argument is for only Far
East versions of Microsoft Excel.

**Remarks**

Only controls on dialog sheets can have accelerator keys. Worksheet
controls cannot have accelerator keys.
