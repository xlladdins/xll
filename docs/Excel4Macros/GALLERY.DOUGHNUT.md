GALLERY.DOUGHNUT
================

Changes the format of the active chart to a doughnut chart.

**GALLERY.DOUGHNUT**(**type\_num**, delete\_overlay)

**GALLERY.DOUGHNUT**?(type\_num, delete\_overlay)

Type\_num    is the number of the format you want to apply to the
doughnut chart.

Delete\_overlay    is a logical value specifying whether to delete an
overlay chart.

-   If delete\_overlay is TRUE, Microsoft Excel deletes all overlays, if
    > present, and applies the new format to the main chart.

-   If delete\_overlay is FALSE or omitted, Microsoft Excel applies the
    > new format to either the main chart or the overlay, depending on
    > the location of the selected series.
