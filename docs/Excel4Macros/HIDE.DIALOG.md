# HIDE.DIALOG

Closes the dialog box that has the current focus.

**Syntax**

**HIDE.DIALOG**(cancel\_logical)

Cancel\_logical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that specifies
whether to close the dialog box and validate any edit boxes. If FALSE,
the dialog box is closed and edit boxes are validated, or checked to
determine if they contain a valid data type. If TRUE, the dialog box is
closed and the edit boxes are not validated.

**Remarks**

If the edit box does not contain a valid data type when the dialog box
is closed, the dialog will remain open. For example, if the edit box is
supposed to contain integer values, and a text value is entered, the
dialog box will not close. This applies to only those dialog boxes that
must be closed before any further user action can happen.

**Examples**

HIDE.DIALOG(FALSE) closes the dialog box and checks to see if the edit
box contains a valid data type (validated)
