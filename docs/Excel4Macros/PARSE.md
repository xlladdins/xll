PARSE

Distributes the contents of the current selection to fill several
adjacent columns; the selection can be no more than one column wide. Use
PARSE to reorganize data, especially data that you've read from files
created by another application, such as a database.

**Syntax**

**PARSE**(parse\_text, destination\_ref)

**PARSE**?(parse\_text, destination\_ref)

Parse\_text    is the parse line in the form of text. It is a copy of
the first nonblank cell in the selected column, with square brackets
indicating where to distribute (or parse) text. If parse\_text is
omitted, Microsoft Excel guesses where to place the brackets based on
the spacing and formatting of data.

Destination\_ref    is a reference to the upper-left corner of the range
of cells where you want to place the parsed data. If destination\_ref is
omitted, it is assumed to be the current selection, so the parsed data
will replace the original data.

**Remarks**

When you use the PARSE function, Microsoft Excel splits the first column
into as many columns as you specify with parse\_text and replaces any
information in those columns.
