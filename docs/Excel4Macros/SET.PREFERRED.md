SET.PREFERRED

Changes the default format that Microsoft Excel uses when you create a
new chart or when you format a chart PREFERRED macro function. When you
use the SET.PREFERRED function, the format of the active chart becomes
the preferred format.

**Syntax**

Format    is the name of the format that you want as the default format
for charts. If omitted, the format of the currently active chart is
used. If format is "Built\_in", then Microsoft Excel will use the
standard, built-in chart as the default. If the chart was created in
Microsoft Excel version 4.0 and if format is "PREFERRED", then the
preferred chart format used in Microsoft Excel version 4.0 will be used.
Format is case sensitive.
