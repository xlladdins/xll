faster.

Logical    is a logical value specifying whether screen updating is on
or off.

  - > If logical is TRUE, Microsoft Excel selects screen updating.

  - > If logical is FALSE, Microsoft Excel clears screen updating.

  - > If logical is omitted, Microsoft Excel changes the current screen
    > update condition.

>  

**Remarks**

  - > Screen updating is always turned back on when a macro ends.

  - > You can use GET.WORKSPACE to determine whether screen updating is
    > on or off.
