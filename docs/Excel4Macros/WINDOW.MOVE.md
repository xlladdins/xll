WINDOW.MOVE

Equivalent to clicking the Move command on the Control menu in Microsoft
Excel for Windows or moving a window by dragging its title bar or its
icon. Moves the active window so that its upper-left corner is at the
specified horizontal and vertical positions. The dialog-box form,
WINDOW.MOVE?, is supported only in Microsoft Excel for Windows.

**Syntax**

**WINDOW.MOVE**(x\_pos, y\_pos, window\_text)

**WINDOW.MOVE**?(x\_pos, y\_pos, window\_text)

X\_pos    is the horizontal position to which you want to move the
window. X\_pos is measured in points. A point is 1/72nd of an inch.

  - > In Microsoft Excel for Windows, x\_pos is measured from the left
    > edge of your workspace to the left edge of the window.

  - > In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, x\_pos is measured from the
    > left edge of your screen to the left edge of the window.

  - > If x\_pos is omitted, the window does not move horizontally.

Y\_pos    is the vertical position to which you want to move the window.
Y\_pos in measured in points from the bottom edge of the formula bar to
the top edge of the window. If y\_pos is omitted, the window does not
move vertically.

Window\_text    specifies which window to restore.

  - > Window\_text is text enclosed in quotation marks or a reference to
    > a cell containing text.

  - > If window\_text is omitted, it is assumed to be the name of the
    > active window.

>  

**Remarks**

  - > If the window is minimized, WINDOW.MOVE moves the icon on the
    > workspace. Measurements are relative to the upper-left corner of
    > the workspace and the icon.

  - > WINDOW.MOVE does not change the size of the window or affect
    > whether the specified window is active or inactive.

  - > In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, if window\_text is
    > "Clipboard", WINDOW.MOVE moves the Clipboard. The Clipboard must
    > already be available; if it is not available, use the
    > SHOW.CLIPBOARD function before using the WINDOW.MOVE function.

  - > WINDOW.MOVE replaces MOVE in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel.
