WORKBOOK.SCROLL

Scrolls through the sheets in a workbook.

**Syntax**

**WORKBOOK.SCROLL**(**num\_sheets**, firstlast\_logical)

Num\_sheets. is a number specifying how many sheets to scroll and the
direction of scrolling. Positive numbers scroll forward by that many
sheets. Negative numbers scroll backward by that many sheets. Zero (0)
does not scroll.

Firstlast\_logical    specifies whether to scroll to the first or last
sheet in the workbook. If TRUE, scrolls to the last sheet in the
workbook. If FALSE, scrolls to the first sheet in the workbook. If this
argument is specified, then num\_sheets is ignored.
