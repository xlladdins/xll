TRACER.DISPLAY

Equivalent to clicking the Trace Precedents or Trace Dependents buttons
on the Auditing toolbar on a worksheet. Allows tracer arrow to be
graphically displayed showing relationship among cells.

**Syntax**

**TRACER.DISPLAY**(direction, create)

Direction    is logical value which, if TRUE, displays tracer arrows for
precedents. If FALSE tracer arrows for dependents are displayed.

Create    is a logical value which, if TRUE displays the next level of
tracer arrows in the direction specified by direction. If FALSE, removes
the current level of tracer arrows in the direction specified by
direction. A level is the number of "arrows" away from the source cell.

**Remark**

Returns the \#VALUE\! error value if not available; for example, the
selection is something other than a worksheet, or the cell(s) cannot be
traced.

**Related Function**

[TRACER.CLEAR](TRACER.CLEAR.md)   Clears all tracer arrows on the worksheet
