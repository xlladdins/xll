# SQL.RETRIEVE.TO.FILE

Retrieves all of the results from a previously executed query and places
them in a file. The connection used must have already been established
using the macro function SQL.OPEN. Also, a query must already have been
executed using SQL.EXEC.QUERY and results must be pending.

If this function is not available, you must install the Microsoft ODBC
add-in (XLODBC.XLA).

**Syntax**

**SQL.RETRIEVE.TO.FILE**(**connection\_num**, **destination**,
col\_names\_logical, column\_delimiter)

Connection\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the unique connection ID for a
data source. The data source specified must have query results pending.
Pending results were generated by a previous call to SQL.EXEC.QUERY on
the same connection.

  - > If there are no pending results on the connection
    > SQL.RETRIEVE.TO.FILE returns the \#N/A error value. The file is
    > not affected.

  - > If connection\_num is not valid, SQL.RETRIEVE.TO.FILE returns the
    > \#VALUE\! error value.


Destination&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the name and path of the
file where the results should be placed. SQL.RETRIEVE.TO.FILE will open
the specified file and fill it with the entire result set.

  - > The format of the data in the file will be compatible with the
    > Microsoft Excel ".CSV" format. The overall format will be that
    > columns will be separated by the value in column\_delimiter (see
    > below) and the individual rows will be separated by a
    > linefeed/carriage-return.

  - > If the file specified by destination cannot be opened then the
    > error value \#N/A will be returned by SQL.RETRIEVE.TO.FILE.

  - > If the file already exists its previous contents will be
    > overwritten by SQL.RETRIEVE.TO.FILE.


Col\_names\_logical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that, if
TRUE, allows the column names to be returned as the first row of data.
If FALSE or omitted, the column names will not be returned.

Column\_delimiter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the value that will be used
to separate the elements in each row. If column\_delimiter is omitted
then a tab will be used. If another value is desired then it should be
enclosed in quotation marks. Possible values for column\_delimiter might
be: "," or ";" or " ". The string "tab" can also be used to specify a
tab separator (even though this is redundant, since a tab is the
default).

**Remarks**

  - > If SQL.RETRIEVE.TO.FILE is unable to retrieve the results on the
    > specified connection then an error value will be returned. In such
    > a case SQL.RETRIEVE.TO.FILE will place error information in memory
    > for the SQL.ERROR function, if such information is available.

  - > If SQL.RETRIEVE.TO.FILE is able to successfully return rows of
    > results on the specified connection and place them in a file it
    > will return the number of rows that were actually written to the
    > file. If there were no results pending on the connection then
    > SQL.RETRIEVE.TO.FILE will return the \#N/A error value and the
    > file will not be created or modified.

  - > Before calling SQL.RETRIEVE.TO.FILE a connection must be
    > established with a data source using SQL.OPEN.

  - > A successful call to SQL.OPEN returns a unique connection ID
    > number, which can be used in a call to SQL.EXEC.QUERY to send a
    > SQL language query. Following this call to SQL.EXEC.QUERY,
    > SQL.RETRIEVE.TO.FILE uses the same connection ID number to
    > retrieve query results and place them in a file.

**Example**

SQL.RETRIEVE.TO.FILE(conn1,"C:\\MSQUERY\\RESULTS1.QRY",TRUE,",")
retrieves the results of a previously executed query and places them in
the file RESULTS1.QRY, with column names that are comma delimited.
