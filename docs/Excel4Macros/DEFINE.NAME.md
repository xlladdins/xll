DEFINE.NAME

Equivalent to clicking the Define command on the Name submenu of the
Insert menu. Defines a name on the active sheet or macro sheet. Use
DEFINE.NAME instead of SET.NAME when you want to define a name on the
active sheet.

**Syntax**

**DEFINE.NAME**(**name\_text**, refers\_to, macro\_type, shortcut\_text,
hidden, category, local)

**DEFINE.NAME**?(name\_text, refers\_to, macro\_type, shortcut\_text,
hidden, category, local)

Name\_textÂ Â Â Â is the text you want to use as the name. Names cannot
include spaces, and cannot look like cell references.

Refers\_toÂ Â Â Â describes what name\_text should refer to, and can be any
of the following values.

<table>

<tr class="odd">

<tr class="even">

Macro\_typeÂ Â Â Â is a number from 1 to 3 that indicates the type of macro.

| 3 or omitted    | None (that is, name\_text does not refer to a macro) |

Shortcut\_textÂ Â Â Â is a text value that specifies the macro shortcut key.
Shortcut\_text must be a single letter, such as "z" or "Z".

HiddenÂ Â Â Â is a logical value specifying whether to define the name as a
hidden name. If hidden is TRUE, Microsoft Excel defines the name as a
hidden name; if FALSE or omitted, Microsoft Excel defines the name
normally.

CategoryÂ Â Â Â is a number or text identifying the category of a custom
function and corresponds to categories in the Function Category list
box.

  - > Categories are numbered starting with 1, the first category in the
    > list.

  - > If category is text but is not one of the existing function types,
    > Microsoft Excel creates a new category and assigns your custom
    > function to it.

LocalÂ Â Â Â is a logical value which, if TRUE, defines the name on just the
current sheet or macro sheet. If FALSE or omitted, defines the name for
all sheets in the workbook.

**Remarks**

  - > You can use hidden names to define values that you want to prevent
    > the user from seeing or changing; they do not appear in the Define
    > Name, Paste Name, or Goto dialog boxes. Hidden names can only be
    > created with the DEFINE.NAME macro function.

  - > If you are recording a macro and you define a name to refer to a
    > formula, Microsoft Excel converts A1-style references to
    > R1C1-style references. For example, if the active cell is C2, and
    > you define the name Previous to refer to =B2, Microsoft Excel
    > records that command as DEFINE.NAME("Previous","=RC\[-1\]").

  - > In DEFINE.NAME?, the dialog-box form of the function, if
    > refers\_to is not specified, the current selection is proposed in
    > the Refers To box. Also, if a name is not specified, text in the
    > active cell is proposed as the name.

LocalÂ Â Â Â is a logical value which, if TRUE, defines the name on just the
current sheet or macro sheet. If FALSE or omitted, defines the name for
all sheets in the workbook.

**Remarks**

  - > You can use hidden names to define values that you want to prevent
    > the user from seeing or changing; they do not appear in the Define

[DELETE.NAME](DELETE.NAME.md)Â Â Â Deletes a name

[GET.DEF](GET.DEF.md)Â Â Â Returns a name matching a definition

[GET.NAME](GET.NAME.md)Â Â Â Returns the definition of a name

[NAMES](NAMES.md)Â Â Â Returns the names defined iDEFINE.NAME

Equivalent to clicking the Define command on the Name submenu of the
Insert menu. Defines a name on the active sheet or macro sheet. Use
DEFINE.NAME instead of SET.NAME when you want to define a name on the
active sheet.

**Syntax**

**DEFINE.NAME**(**name\_text**, refers\_to, macro\_type, shortcut\_text,
hidden, category, local)

**DEFINE.NAME**?(name\_text, refers\_to, macro\_type, shortcut\_text,
hidden, category, local)

Name\_textÂ Â Â Â is the text you want to use as the name. Names cannot
include spaces, and cannot look like cell references.

Refers\_toÂ Â Â Â describes what name\_text should refer to, and can be any
of the following values.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>If refers_to is</strong></td>
<td><strong>Then name_text is</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>A number, text, or logical value</td>
<td>Defined to refer to that value</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>An external reference, such as !$A$1 or SALES!$A$1:$C$3</td>
<td>Defined to refer to those cells</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>A formula in the form of text, such as "=2*PI()/360" (if the formula contains references, they must be R1C1-style references, such as<br />
"=R2C2*(1+RC[-1])")</td>
<td>Defined to refer to that formula</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Omitted</td>
<td>Defined to refer to the current selection</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The next two arguments, macro\_type and shortcut\_text, apply only if
the sheet in the active window is a macro sheet.

Macro\_typeÂ Â Â Â is a number from 1 to 3 that indicates the type of macro.

|                 |                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Macro\_type** | **Type of macro**                                    |
| 1               | Custom function (also known as a function macro)     |
| 2               | Command macro.                                       |
| 3 or omitted    | None (that is, name\_text does not refer to a macro) |

Shortcut\_textÂ Â Â Â is a text value that specifies the macro shortcut key.
Shortcut\_text must be a single letter, such as "z" or "Z".

HiddenÂ Â Â Â is a logical value specifying whether to define the name as a
hidden name. If hidden is TRUE, Microsoft Excel defines the name as a
hidden name; if FALSE or omitted, Microsoft Excel defines the name
normally.

CategoryÂ Â Â Â is a number or text identifying the category of a custom
function and corresponds to categories in the Function Category list
box.

  - > Categories are numbered starting with 1, the first category in the
    > list.

  - > If category is text but is not one of the existing function types,
    > Microsoft Excel creates a new category and assigns your custom
    > function to it.

LocalÂ Â Â Â is a logical value which, if TRUE, defines the name on just the
current sheet or macro sheet. If FALSE or omitted, defines the name for
all sheets in the workbook.

**Remarks**

  - > You can use hidden names to define values that you want to prevent
    > the user from seeing or changing; they do not appear in the Define
    > Name, Paste Name, or Goto dialog boxes. Hidden names can only be
    > created with the DEFINE.NAME macro function.

  - > If you are recording a macro and you define a name to refer to a
    > formula, Microsoft Excel converts A1-style references to
    > R1C1-style references. For example, if the active cell is C2, and
    > you define the name Previous to refer to =B2, Microsoft Excel
    > records that command as DEFINE.NAME("Previous","=RC\[-1\]").

  - > In DEFINE.NAME?, the dialog-box form of the function, if
    > refers\_to is not specified, the current selection is proposed in
    > the Refers To box. Also, if a name is not specified, text in the
    > active cell is proposed as the name.
