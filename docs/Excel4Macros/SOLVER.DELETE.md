SOLVER.DELETE

Equivalent to clicking the Solver command on the Tools menu and clicking
the Delete button in the Solver Parameters dialog box. Deletes an
existing constraint.

If this function is not available, you must install the Solver add-in.

**Syntax**

**SOLVER.DELETE**(**cell\_ref, relation**, formula)

For an explanation of the arguments and constraints, see SOLVER.ADD.

**Remarks**

If the combination of cell\_ref and relation does not match any existing
constraint, the function returns the value 4 and no action is taken. If
the constraint is found, it is deleted, and the function returns the
value 0.
