WAIT

Pauses the macro until the time specified by the serial number.

**Syntax**

**WAIT**(**serial\_number**)

Serial\_number    is the date-time code used by Microsoft Excel for date
and time calculations. You can give serial\_number as text, such as
"4:30 PM", or as a formula, such as NOW()+"00:00:04", instead of as a
number. The text or formula is automatically converted to a serial
number. For more information about serial\_number, see NOW.

**Important   **WAIT suspends all Microsoft Excel activity and may
prevent you from performing other operations on your computer.
Background processes, such as printing and recalculation, are continued.

**Example**

Use WAIT with NOW to pause a macro for a length of time or until the
time specified by the serial number. For example, the following macro
formula waits 3 seconds from the time the functions are evaluated:

WAIT(NOW()+"00:00:03")

**Related Function**

[ON.TIME](ON.TIME.md)   Runs a macro at a specific time
