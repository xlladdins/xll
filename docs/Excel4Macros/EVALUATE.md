EVALUATE

Evaluates a formula or expression that is in the form of text and
returns the result. To run a macro or subroutine, use the RUN function.

**Syntax**

**EVALUATE**(**formula\_text**)

Formula\_text    is the expression in the form of text that you want to
evaluate.

**Remarks**

Using EVALUATE is similar to selecting an expression within a formula in
the formula bar and pressing the Recalculate key (F9 in Microsoft Excel
for Windows and COMMAND+= in Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh).
EVALUATE replaces an expression with a value.

**Example**

Suppose you want to know the value of a cell named LabResult1,
LabResult2, or LabResult3, where the 1, 2, or 3 is specified by the name
TrialNum whose value may change as the macro runs. You can use the
following formula to calculate the value:

EVALUATE("LabResult"\&TrialNum)
